## I. Introduction
### 1. Business questions
- The Company is a digital service provider. The Marketing Department wants to launch targeted campaigns to re-engage inactive users and reward loyal customers. These campaigns are planned around key times of the year, such as major holidays and product launches.
- The Marketing Director has proposed using the RFM model in Python to segment customers based on their behavior and tailor the campaigns accordingly. Analyze the current customer base using the RFM method and provide strategic recommendations to the marketing team.
- With the digital service model of YourCompany, which of the three RFM indicators — **Recency (R)**, **Frequency (F)**, or **Monetary (M)** — should be prioritized for better customer targeting and retention?
### 2. Dataset
Dataset includes 5 different related tables, including: campaign, customer, device_detail, status_detail, ticket_history

### 3. Method: Cohort Analysis  
**Cohort analysis definition**  
- Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics in which you take a group of users and analyze their usage patterns based on their shared traits to better track and understand their actions.
- A cohort is simply a group of people with shared characteristics.  
**Three major types of Cohort**
- Time cohorts: customers who signed up for a product or service during a particular time frame.
- Behavior cohorts: customers who purchased a product or subscribed to a service in the past.
- Size cohorts: refer to the various sizes of customers who purchase the company’s products or services.  
**Cohort type of this project**  
- This project focuses on performing a Cohort Analysis based on Time
- Customers will be divided into acquisition cohorts depending on the month of their first purchase (cohort month)
- The cohort index would then be assigned to each of the customer’s purchases, which will represent the number of months since the first transaction

## II. Data Visualization with Python
Because of the lack of data in 2020 and 2020 (due to the COVID pandemic), I analyzed data from 2019 and 2022
